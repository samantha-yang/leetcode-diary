# End of Week 1 (2/14/2026)

## Problems Completed

1. Contains Duplicate
2. Valid Anagram
3. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks
4. Valid Parentheses

This week, I focused on refreshing the basics, such as hashing, sliding window, and stacks. Although I have done LeetCode before, I have been pretty inconsistent with it. So, I will be documenting what problems I do each week and reflecting on them to:  
1. Review the material  
2. Hold myself accountable

## Problems I Ran Into

1. Sometimes I find myself wanting to just look at the solution if I get stuck. However, it’s important to remember that I should focus on figuring out what I can do and recognizing where I get stuck.
2. Although I am only doing one problem a day for now, I think that is better than doing none at all. We all have to start somewhere.
3. Instead of recognizing patterns, I find myself trying to remember/recall the solution of the problem instead of walking through the problem step by step. I need to slow down and take time walking through each step instead of just diving in and trying to remember solutions.

## Goals for Next Week

1. Solve at least one medium problem
2. Solve at least one problem each day
3. Write another reflection on my progress
