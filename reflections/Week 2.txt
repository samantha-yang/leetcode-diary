Sorry guys, this week's reflection is late since I was busy this weekend. However, I'm making sure I still write one.

This week, I focused on easy problems to work on my fundamentals. I worked on linked lists, trees, and a lot of string manipulation problems. 
1. Trying to recognize patterns in patterns
2. Trying to expose myself to more types of patterns I might see

## Problems I Ran Into
1. I find myself struggling to remember built in Java functions. Even though I know you can look it up, it can be timely and prohibited during OAs.
2. I'm not letting myself struggle enough. I keep wanting to look at solutions quickly and say "oh yeah, I knew that". It's about problem solving, not memorizing solutions.
3. Trying to bridge the gap between easy and medium problems. I find that I can either solve/mostly solve easy questions, but I keep immediately stuck on mediums. Not sure if I should work on more easy questions, or if I should drive straight into mediums.


## Goals from Week 1

1. Solve at least one medium problem ❌
2. Solve at least one problem each day ✅
3. Write another reflection on my progress ✅

## Goals for Next Week

1. Solve at least one medium problem
2. Attempt at least three medium problems
3. Write another weekly reflection to document my journey
