This week, I focused trying to try out and ease myself into solving medium problems. I spent a lot of the first two weeks solving easy problems, but I want to work on mediums.
1. I focused on doing medium problems instead of easy ones. I want to challenge myself more and see "medium-type" patterns/problems.
2. Pattern recognition. I tried to see if I could apply patterns from previous patterns to new problems.
3. I also tried out design problems this week to get comfortable with OOP and refresh my skills.

# Problems I Ran Into
1. I found myself recognizing what patterns I should apply/data structures, but I wasn't able to code my ideas. I think I need to work on reviewing the problem the next day to make sure I really understand it.
2. Again, I find myself always wanting to look at the solution instead of letting myself struggle long enough. I need to focus more on digesting hints instead of getting hasty.
3. I can come up with the brute force solution but not the optimal solution. Not sure if this will just come with time/practice, or if there is a strategy/hint.

# Goals From Week 2

1. Solve at least one medium problem ✅ (I was able to solve Insert Delete GetRandom on my own)
2. Attempt at least three medium problems ✅ (I actually tried out on medium per day, except Sunday)
3. Write another weekly reflection to document my journey ✅

# Goals For Next Week

1. Solve two medium problems on my own
2. Attempt one medium problem per day
3. Try out a topic I haven't explored deeply yet (Tries, backtracking, DP, etc)
